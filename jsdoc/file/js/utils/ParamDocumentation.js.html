No down trim is added when throttle is above TRIM_THROTTLE. Below TRIM_THROTTLE downtrim is added in proportion to the amount the throttle is below TRIM_THROTTLE. At zero throttle the full downpitch specified in this parameter is added. This parameter is meant to help keep airspeed up when flying in FBWA mode with low throttle, such as when on a landing approach, without relying on an airspeed sensor. A value of 2 degrees is good for many planes, although a higher value may be needed for high drag aircraft.&quot;},

The default value is 15 meters, which helps to smooth out waypoint missions where small altitude changes happen near waypoints. If you dont want glide slopes to be used in missions then you can set this to zero, which will disable glide slope calculations. Otherwise you can set it to a minimum number of meters of altitude error to the destination waypoint before a glide slope will be used to change altitude.&quot;},
{name: &quot;GLIDE_SLOPE_THR&quot;, key: &quot;GLIDE_SLOPE_THR&quot;, description: &quot;Glide slope threshold&quot;, value: &quot;&quot;, user: &quot;Advanced&quot;, range: &quot;0 100&quot;, increment: &quot;1&quot;, units: &quot;meters&quot;, documentation: &quot;This controls the height above the glide slope the plane may be before rebuilding a glide slope.

documentation: &quot;When enabled, this adds user stick input to the control surfaces in auto modes, allowing the user to have some degree of flight control without changing modes.  There are two types of stick mixing available. If you set STICK_MIXING to 1 then it will use fly by wire mixing, which controls the roll and pitch in the same way that the FBWA mode does. This is the safest option if you usually fly ArduPlane in FBWA or FBWB mode. If you set STICK_MIXING to 2 then it will enable direct mixing mode, which is what the STABILIZE mode uses. That will allow for much more extreme maneuvers while in AUTO mode.&quot;},

This can be be used for catapult launches where you want the motor to engage only after the plane leaves the catapult, but it is preferable to use the TKOFF_THR_MINACC and TKOFF_THR_DELAY parameters for catapult launches due to the errors associated with GPS measurements. For hand launches with a pusher prop it is strongly advised that this parameter be set to a value no less than 4 m/s to provide additional protection against premature motor start. Note that the GPS velocity will lag the real velocity by about 0.5 seconds. The ground speed check is delayed by the TKOFF_THR_DELAY parameter.&quot;},

This is meant to be used for hand launches. Setting this value to 0 disables the acceleration test which means the ground speed check will always be armed which could allow GPS velocity jumps to start the engine. For hand launches and bungee launches this should be set to around 15.&quot;},

For hand launches with pusher propellers it is essential that this is set to a value of no less than 2 (0.2 seconds) to ensure that the aircraft is safely clear of the throwers arm before the motor can start. For bungee launches a larger value can be used (such as 30) to give time for the bungee to release from the aircraft before the motor is started.&quot;},

It is used to hold the tail wheel of a taildragger on the ground during the initial takeoff stage to give maximum steering. This option should be combined with the TKOFF_TDRAG_SPD1 option and the GROUND_STEER_ALT option along with tuning of the ground steering controller. A value of zero means to bypass the initial tail hold stage of takeoff. Set to zero for hand and catapult launch. For tail-draggers you should normally set this to 100, meaning full up elevator during the initial stage of takeoff. For most tricycle undercarriage aircraft a value of zero will work well, but for some tricycle aircraft a small negative value (say around -20 to -30) will apply down elevator which will hold the nose wheel firmly on the ground during initial acceleration. Only use a negative value if you find that the nosewheel doesnt grip well during takeoff. Too much down elevator on a tricycle undercarriage may cause instability in steering as the plane pivots around the nosewheel. Add down elevator 10 percent at a time.&quot;},

When TKOFF_TDRAG_SPD1 is reached the pitch of the aircraft will be held level until TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD is reached, at which point the takeoff pitch specified in the mission will be used to rotate the pitch for takeoff climb. Set TKOFF_TDRAG_SPD1 to zero to go straight to rotation. This should be set to zero for hand launch and catapult launch. It should also be set to zero for tricycle undercarriages unless you are using the method above to genetly hold the nose wheel down. For tail dragger aircraft it should be set just below the stall speed.&quot;},

If TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD is zero then the climb pitch will be used as soon as takeoff is started. For hand launch and catapult launches a TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD of zero should be set. For all ground launches TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD should be set above the stall speed, usually by about 10 to 30 percent&quot;},

When this is zero the THR_SLEWRATE parameter is used during takeoff. For rolling takeoffs it can be a good idea to set a lower slewrate for takeoff to give a slower acceleration which can improve ground steering control. The value is a percentage throttle change per second, so a value of 20 means to advance the throttle over 5 seconds on takeoff. Values below 20 are not recommended as they may cause the plane to try to climb out with too little throttle.&quot;},

When this is zero the THR_SLEWRATE parameter is used during landing. The value is a percentage throttle change per second, so a value of 20 means to advance the throttle over 5 seconds on landing.

Once this feature is enabled it will stay enabled until the aircraft goes above TKOFF_TDRAG_SPD1 airspeed, changes mode, or the pitch goes above the initial pitch when this is engaged or goes below 0 pitch. When enabled the elevator will be forced to TKOFF_TDRAG_ELEV. This option allows for easier takeoffs on taildraggers in FBWA mode, and also makes it easier to test auto-takeoff steering handling in FBWA. Setting it to 0 disables this option.&quot;},

If that finish line is crossed then the waypoint is considered complete. Note that the navigation controller may decide to turn later than WP_RADIUS before a waypoint, based on how sharp the turn is and the speed of the aircraft. It is safe to set WP_RADIUS much larger than the usual turn radius of your aircraft and the navigation controller will work out when to turn.

You will also need to setup the YAW2SRV_DAMP yaw damping appropriately for your aircraft. A value of 0.5 for YAW2SRV_DAMP is a good starting point.&quot;},

Note that PX4IO manual control will be automatically activated if the FMU crashes for any reason. This parameter allows you to test for correct manual behaviour without actually crashing the FMU. This parameter is can be set to a non-zero value either for ground testing purposes or for giving the effect of an external override control board. Please also see the docs on OVERRIDE_SAFETY. Note that you may set OVERRIDE_CHAN to the same channel as FLTMODE_CH to get PX4IO based override when in flight mode 6. Note that when override is triggered due to a FMU crash the 6 auxiliary output channels on Pixhawk will no longer be updated, so all the flight controls you need must be assigned to the first 8 channels.&quot;},

This controls the horizontal resolution of the terrain data that is stored on te SD card and requested from the ground station. If your GCS is using the worldwide SRTM database then a resolution of 100 meters is appropriate. Some parts of the world may have higher resolution data available, such as 30 meter data available in the SRTM database in the USA. The grid spacing also controls how much data is kept in memory during flight. A larger grid spacing will allow for a larger amount of data in memory. A grid spacing of 100 meters results in the vehicle keeping 12 grid squares in memory with each grid square having a size of 2.7 kilometers by 3.2 kilometers. Any additional grid squares are stored on the SD once they are fetched from the GCS and will be demand loaded as needed.&quot;},

This will only work effectively if there is enough fuselage side area to generate a measureable lateral acceleration when the model sideslips. Flying wings and most gliders cannot use this term. This term should only be adjusted after the basic yaw damper gain YAW2SRV_DAMP is tuned and the YAW2SRV_INT integrator gain has been set.

The default value is 1 which will work for all models. Advanced users can use it to correct for any tendency to yaw away from or into the turn once the turn is established. Increase to make the model yaw more initially and decrease to make the model yaw less initially.

A value of 0.75 is a good default and will work with nearly all rovers. Ground steering in aircraft needs a bit smaller time constant, and a value of 0.5 is recommended for best ground handling in fixed wing aircraft. A value of 0.75 means that the controller will try to correct any deviation between the desired and actual steering angle in 0.75 seconds.

documentation: &quot;The orientation of the compass relative to the autopilot board. This will default to the right value for each board type, but can be changed if you have an external compass. See the documentation for your external compass for the right value. The correct orientation should give the X axis forward, the Y axis to the right and the Z axis down. So if your aircraft is pointing west it should show a positive value for the Y axis, and a value close to zero for the X axis. On a PX4 or Pixhawk with an external compass the correct value is zero if the compass is correctly oriented. NOTE: This orientation is combined with any AHRS_ORIENTATION setting.&quot;},

A value closer to 2 will result in the plane ignoring height error during landing and our experience has been that the plane will therefore keep the nose up -- sometimes good for a glider landing (with the side effect that you will likely glide a ways past the landing point).  A value closer to 0 results in the plane ignoring speed error -- use caution when lowering the value below 1 -- ignoring speed could result in a stall. Values between 0 and 2 are valid values for a fixed landing weight. When using -1 the weight will be scaled during the landing.

With this enabled the flare sinkrate will increase/decrease the flare sink demand as you get further beyond the LAND waypoint. Has no effect before the waypoint. This value is added to TECS_LAND_SINK proportional to distance traveled after wp. With an increasing sink rate you can still land in a given distance if youre traveling too fast and cruise passed the land point. A positive value will force the plane to land sooner proportional to distance passed land point. A negative number will tell the plane to slowly climb allowing for a pitched-up stall landing.
